# Welcome to Joy Treasury

Joy Treasury is a collection of [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/) blocks. It is a place to discover and explore the best Joy UI has to offer.

This is not a UI component library. Instead, we offer a CLI tool to let you clone the blocks you want into your own project. You can tweak and customize them to your heart's content. The best part? you own the code!.

## Usage

1. Install the CLI tool globally:

2. Choose a block from the sidebar on the left. You can also use the search bar at the top of the sidebar to search for a specific block.
3.

## What is a block?

A block is a self-contained component that can be used in any Joy UI application. A block can be as simple as a button or as complex as an entire page.
